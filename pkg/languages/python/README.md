## Integration with SandboxRunner

The Python runtime support integrates seamlessly with the existing SandboxRunner architecture:

1. **Container Integration**: All operations execute within secure runC containers
2. **MCP Tool Integration**: Exposed through MCP tools for client interaction
3. **Resource Management**: Respects container resource limits and timeouts
4. **State Persistence**: Uses SQLite storage for caching and state management
5. **Logging Integration**: Uses zerolog for structured logging and monitoring

## Security Model

- **Container Isolation**: All Python operations run in isolated containers
- **Resource Limits**: CPU, memory, and disk usage constraints
- **Network Isolation**: Configurable network access controls
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all user inputs
- **Security Scanning**: Built-in vulnerability detection and reporting

## Performance Optimization

- **Package Caching**: Intelligent caching of installed packages
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time feedback for long-running operations
- **Lazy Loading**: Components loaded only when needed
- **Concurrent Operations**: Thread-safe operations for parallel execution
- **Memory Management**: Efficient memory usage with cleanup routines

## Usage Examples

```go
// Package Installation
installer := NewPipInstaller("/workspace", "python3")
result, err := installer.Install(ctx, &InstallRequest{
    Packages: []string{"requests", "numpy==1.21.0"},
    UseVirtualEnv: true,
})

// Environment Management  
manager := NewEnvironmentManager("/workspace")
env, err := manager.CreateVirtualEnvironment(ctx, &EnvironmentSetupOptions{
    EnvName: "myproject",
    PythonVersion: "3.9",
})

// Code Analysis
analyzer := NewCodeAnalyzer(nil)
result, err := analyzer.Analyze(ctx, &AnalysisRequest{
    Code: pythonCode,
    Filename: "script.py",
})

// Security Scanning
scanner := NewSecurityScanner()
issues := scanner.Scan(pythonCode)

// Debugging
debugger := NewPythonDebugger(nil)
session, err := debugger.StartDebugSession(ctx, &DebugRequest{
    Code: pythonCode,
    Breakpoints: []*Breakpoint{{File: "script.py", Line: 10}},
})
```

## Future Enhancements
